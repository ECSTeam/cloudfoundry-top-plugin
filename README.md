# Installation

* **Download the binary file for your target OS from the latest [release](https://github.com/kkellner/cloudfoundry-top-plugin/releases/latest)**
* If you've already installed the plugin and are updating, you must first run `cf uninstall-plugin TopPlugin`
* Then install the plugin with `cf install-plugin top-plugin-darwin`  (or `top-plugin-linux` or `top-plugin.exe`)
* If you get a permission error run: `chmod +x top-plugin-darwin` (or `top-plugin-linux`) on the binary
* Verify the plugin installed by looking for it with `cf plugins`

TODO: Register plugin with the community cloud foundry plugins website (https://plugins.cloudfoundry.org/)
<!---
```bash
cf add-plugin-repo CF-Community http://plugins.cloudfoundry.org/
cf install-plugin ./top-plugin-osx
```

## Assign needed permissions

To use this plugin you must be logged in as 'admin' or assign two permissions
to an existing PCF user.  To assign needed permissions:

Install the uaac client CLI if you do not already have it:
```
gem install cf-uaac
```

Login and add two permission.  Note that the UAA password is NOT the
"Admin Credentials", the password is found in the ERT under Credentials tab,
look for password for "Admin Client Credentials".

```
uaac token client get admin -s [UAA Admin Client Credentials]  
uaac member add cloud_controller.admin [username]
uaac member add doppler.firehose [username]
```
Note: The change in permissions does not take effect until user username performs
a logout and login.
