**App Container CRASH View**

App Container CRASH view shows a list of all application containers
that have crashed.  A crash normally happens when the application 
running in the container stops or exits unexpectedly.  Often an exit
status code is recorded in the EXIT_DESCRIPTION which may help
understand what happened.  

Java exit status codes:
    137 = OutOfMemory error
    143 = SIGTERM (sometimes as a result of OutOfMemory error)
    255 = OutOfMemory, file descriptors, other error
`

**CRASH List Columns:**

  CRASH_TIME - Date/time of the crash (24 hour format in local timezone)
  IDX - Application container index that crashed
